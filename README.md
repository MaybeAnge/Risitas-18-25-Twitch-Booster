## History üñºÔ∏è

The Twitch Booster virus was created in 2016 by members of the jeuxvideo.com forum, primarily in the 18-25 section. This malware targeted Twitch streamers' PCs, especially those of young users. It spread through coordinated raids, where multiple users would infect victims' computers to provoke dramatic reactions.

Upon launching, the virus triggered several effects: a voice would play, mouse clicks were reversed, the wallpaper would change, a "Melter" effect appeared, and numerous insulting pop-ups flooded the screen. Once the "show" ended, the PC was formatted, and all personal data was lost. The only option left was to reinstall Windows.
